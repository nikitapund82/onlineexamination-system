Online examination systems are rapidly replacing traditional methods due to their speed, accuracy, and efficiency. They save time and resources for both organizations and examinees, while also being environmentally friendly.  Examinees access the system with unique IDs and passwords, taking tests electronically.  Key features include secure login, automated evaluation, and profile management. Administrators manage topics, questions, users, and results through a dedicated panel.  The system aims to streamline examinations, minimize errors, and ensure security.  Developing such systems with PHP offers valuable learning experience, addressing the increasing need for efficient and scalable assessments.
